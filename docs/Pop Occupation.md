## Worker slot
- Every building has a max number of worker slots
- A pop is assigned to a worker slot of a certain building (pop works in a building)

## Assignment rules
- If Pop does not work in a building by the end of turn (for example building was destroyed or pop was just born in this turn or resettled from other settlement etc), then
	- If exists a building in the same settlement with a free worker slot - assign pop there
	- If pop is unemployed - something may happen (to define)
