# Game Design Document

## **Game Title**
*Mythic Steel* (maybe will be changed)

## **Core Concept**
A strategy-RPG hybrid set in an ancient/medieval world. Players manage settlements, resources, and exploration while progressing through technological ages (e.g., Copper, Bronze, Iron, Steel). The focus is on resource production, trade, and survival in a dynamic, procedurally generated world.

## **Core Mechanics (brief description)**

### **1. Buildings
Full design: [[Buildings]]


Players construct and upgrade various building types, each essential to colony growth:

- **Production Buildings**: Farms (food), Mines (ores), Workshops (tools, goods), Kitchens (prepared food).
- **Residential Buildings**: Provide housing and comfort, influencing colonist mood and productivity.
- **Storage Facilities**: Warehouses for resource management and distribution.
- **Specialized Structures**: Improve production efficiency, provide bonuses, or enable specific production options (e.g., furnaces, carpenter huts).

### **2. Population System**

The population consists of diverse colonists, each with unique traits and skills:

- Colonists belong to different races (e.g., dwarfs, giants), each race excelling in certain tasks (dwarfs in mining and crafting, giants in heavy labor).
- Colonists possess individual needs (food, shelter, amenities) and mood states influenced by living conditions and resource quality.
- Energy-based work system, with each colonist having limited energy per turn for task assignments.
- Mood and productivity management through optimized task assignments and quality of life improvements.

### **3. Resource Production**

Resource production is managed via buildings and colonist assignments:

- **Plain Production**: Basic resource generation (food from farms, ores from mines).
- **Processing Production**: Converts raw resources into refined products (ores into metal bars).
- **Transportation**: Ensures resources move effectively between buildings and storage.
- Production efficiency influenced by colonist skills, racial traits, and building upgrades.


### **4. Economy and Trade**

The economy is structured around production, quotas, and trade with an external supervising overlord:

- Mandatory resource quotas must be regularly fulfilled.
- Players trade surplus goods for currency, essential to buy resources, improve buildings, or hire specialized colonists.
- Economic decisions impact colony sustainability, growth, and strategic planning.
- Dynamic trading conditions influenced by supply and demand, resource quality, and colonist productivity.

## **Next Steps**
1. **Finalize Exploration Mechanics**:
   - Design specific event types and rewards.
2. **Refine Trade Systems**:
   - Simplify dynamic pricing and route logistics.
3. **Develop Prototype**:
   - Focus on settlement building, resource management, and exploration.
