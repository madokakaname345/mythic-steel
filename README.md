A turn-based, top-down colony simulation inspired by RimWorld and Sid Meier's Colonization. Players strategically build and manage a thriving settlement, assigning diverse colonists to jobs, handling resource production, transportation, and navigating economic trade pressures from an overseeing authority.

## Features

- **Strategic Colony Management**: Construct various buildings, assign colonists, and carefully manage production chains.
- **Diverse Colonists**: Multiple races with distinct traits (e.g., dwarfs excel at mining, giants handle heavy labor efficiently).
- **Resource Economy**: Produce, process, and transport resources strategically to sustain and grow your colony.
- **Dynamic Trade**: Fulfill quotas and trade surplus resources, balancing internal growth with external economic demands.

## Tech Stack

- **Engine**: Godot
- **Programming Language**: GDScript
- **Art Style**: 2D top-down strategy
